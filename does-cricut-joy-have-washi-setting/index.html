Cricut Joy What Materials &amp; Accessories Do You REALLY From pinterest.com
All you have to do is pull up the design on your phone, plug in the power cord, and load the material into the machine. I can set it up in less than a minute and most projects only take a few minutes to cut. Just like the other cricut machines of the family, the cricut joy can both cut and write, but it does so using a host of tools specifically designed for the smaller footprint. Through my personal use with this project, i felt that my money was not wasted when i decided to purchase it.
