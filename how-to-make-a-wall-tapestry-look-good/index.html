One of my favorite ways i’ve seen to hold back a tapestry curtain is by screwing an old, vintage doorknob into the wall just to the side of the window and tucking the tapestry behind it when you want to let some sunlight in or look at the rain. From bold patterns and bright colors to neutral wall hangings, tapestries are just what you need to take your room to the next level. These holes should fit the size screws that you will be using. A lot of you have been asking me how i hang up my wall tapestry so i thought i would make this video in which i show you how i do that, and also show you.
