How to Store Root Vegetables So They Stay Fresh Longer From thespruce.com
To sum it all up, while seeds don’t necessarily “go bad” on their expiration date, the longer they sit, the less likely they’re still viable. Some seeds, such as spinach, lettuce, and corn, may not last much longer than a year. How long seeds remain viable depends on the type of seed and how well it is stored. Seeds store best below 40°f with less than 10 percent humidity, tucked inside airtight containers in a dark environment.
